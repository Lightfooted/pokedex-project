## Description:
An online Pokédex that allows users to view and search for their favorite original 151 Pokémon. The user MUST create an account first by username, email and password. The password MUST be at least 10 characters long. Once logged in, the user is then sent to the dashboard where they are presented with a search form. In this form they may type in the name of any of the original 151 Pokémon. Once the data is sent, the result brings up a card. The Pokémon stats will display along with the username written on the card. Congratulations! You caught your first Pokémon! To do another search simply click on the dashboard button. When you've finished your hunt, you may hit the logout button!

## Creator Notes

 I wanted to describe the challenges we faced and offer advice for future coders.

* The challenges:

 Time. Time was a huge challenge. We had to rewrite a lot of our code due to unforeseen circumstances, were a two-person group, and had crazy work schedules. It was a lot to take in on such a short deadline.

* My advice:

 Don't fall behind on lessons and their assignments. They're SUPER helpful and will save you frustration in the long run. Don't be ashamed to go back on old material you aced on. Sometimes you forget how something worked and why and need to refresh your memory. Constant and clear communication with your team is a major key to success!
